I recently started my journey in data science. When it comes to learning and working, I don't like to box myself, just like Yaeji (if you listen to her music), I'm into it all.

This website is dedicated to my continuous learning in data science and a platform to show my skills and creativity. I hope you learn a thing or two from my posts. My posts will include numerous data science tools like Tableau and Rapid Miner, involving programming languages like R and Python.

Moving forward, I would love to learn more about machine learning, deep learning and the different aspects of software engineering.

If I am not working on my projects, I am probably walking my two spaniels or arguing who gets more wine with my partner.

Thank you to contributors on pexels and Sylhare for the Jekyll theme.

If you think I can help you or if you have any questions at all, for the love of dogs, send me an email.
