<p style="text-align: justify;">
I recently started my journey in data science in 2017. Prior to that, I attended one of the medical schools in Dublin, Ireland. I have written blog posts before and I have an experience in medical writing specifically for medical education in anatomy.
<br><br>
This website is dedicated to my continuous learning in data science and a platform to show my skills and creativity. I hope you learn a thing or two from my posts.
<br>
I am interested to learn and develop my skills in data visualisation and communication, machine learning and deep learning.
<br><br>
My posts will include numerous data science topics and tools but will be geared towards these three areas. So you can expect to see a lot of posts on Tableau and Tensorflow.
<br>
Occasionally, I like to dip my hands in design using Adobe Suite. So you will see my amateur designs throughout the website.
<br>
Coming from a non-technical or non-technology background, my blog posts will be written in plain English without too many technical jargons.
<br><br>
If I am not working on my projects, I am probably walking my two spaniels or arguing who gets more wine with my partner.
<br><br>
I would like to thank the contributors on pexels and Sylhare for the Jekyll theme.
<br>
Please join me in the discussion. If you think I can help you or if you have any questions at all, for the love of dogs, Iâ€™m only an email away.
